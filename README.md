## User Interactions
First, login using the following credentials:\
username: user\
password: user

Next, you will be redirected to the main Events page.
Here, you can view already created events, join events, as well as create your
own event using the button at the top of the page, which will present a new interface
for entering the event details.

On the left sidebar, there are navigation buttons for navigating between the main events
page and the user profile page.

On the user profile page, you will find your user rating, as well as a display of the
events you've created or joined.

Navigating between these pages also changes the right sidebar's contents.
On the main event page, the right sidebar presents filters for filtering events by
various parameters.
On the user profile page, the right sidebar presents an interface to change the user's
password.

On either page, viewing an event will open a new interface displaying the event's detailed
information. Editing your own event will open a similar interface where the information
can be changed.
